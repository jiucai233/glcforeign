## Move-in Procedure

### Application Process
 Applications must be submitted via the Yonsei Portal Service (portal.yonsei.ac.kr). After logging in, go to the "Academic Information" menu and complete the move-in application under the "Dormitory” section.


### Dormitory Fee Payment
 The payment must be made to the assigned virtual account. After logging into the Yonsei Portal Service, you can find the virtual account information in the "Dormitory" section under the "Academic Information" menu. Dormitory fees vary depending on the applicant's income level: a 3-person room costs 905,600 KRW, and a 2-person room costs 1,382,000 KRW. Generally, 3-person rooms are more common.


### Move-in Process
 The move-in hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
 Room assignments are made at the lobby of the dormitory buildings (A~G).
 If you arrive outside of the move-in period, you must check in at the security office of either building A (dormitory 1) or building D (dormitory 2).
 
**Required documents for move-in include:**
Chest X-ray certificate (issued within 60 days of the move-in date)
MMR vaccine certificate

Tip 1: If you haven't had the chest X-ray, you can use the tuberculosis screening bus, which usually costs 9,000 KRW, cheaper than going to a hospital. However, a Korean phone number registered under your name is required to use this service. The bus visits campus after the move-in period and runs only on specific dates and times, so check the GLC group chat regularly to not miss the schedule.

Tip 2: If you can't bring the required documents (such as the chest X-ray result or MMR certificate) on the move-in day, inform the security staff that you will submit them later. However, if you miss the submission deadline, access to the dormitory card may be restricted, so it’s best to submit them as soon as possible.

Tip 3: You will need your ID when you move in. If you request a cart to move your luggage, you must leave your ID as a deposit.
### Facilities & Amenities
 Booking-based spaces include study rooms, seminar rooms, band practice rooms, and dance practice rooms. Reservations can be made through [Yonsei Portal Service > Administrative LINK > Space Reservation System].
 Open spaces are available 24/7 without reservation, such as multimedia rooms, laptop study rooms, board game rooms, table tennis rooms, student lounges, self-kitchens, and unmanned laundromats.


### Surrounding Environment & Transportation
 Campus Town Station on Incheon Subway Line 1 is nearby, making it easy to travel to Seoul and major areas. Additionally, a shuttle bus to the International Campus operates, so be sure to check the schedule and reservation method in advance.
 Shuttle Bus Reservation: Log into the Yonsei Portal Service, click on the IT services, and reserve a seat for the International Campus shuttle. The demand is high between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM and on Fridays, so make your reservations early.


### Useful Tips
 Dorm Essentials:
Required documents for move-in
Bedding, clothes, shoes, hangers
Skincare products, laundry basket, laundry supplies
Dishware (spoon, microwave-safe containers, cups, tumbler, etc.)
Study supplies (iPad, laptop, writing tools, notebooks, sticky notes, pens)
Chargers, umbrella, indoor slippers
Bathroom mat, multi-plug, basic medications, hair dryer
### Additional Tips:
Starting from the 2024-2nd semester, electric scooters are banned on campus, but electric bicycles are still allowed.
There is currently a 1,000 KRW breakfast event, and at specific times, you can get breakfast for as low as 100 KRW. Check the dormitory dining hall for details.
While there is no official curfew, access is restricted between 2:00 AM and 5:30 AM. During this time, you can only enter through building A (dormitory 1), or building D or building G for dormitory 2 residents.

## 2. Tutor/Tutee Program
Global Leadership College (GLC) operates a tutoring matching program to assist students with their coursework and university life adjustment.
### What is GLC Tutoring?
 GLC tutoring involves a collaboration between a first-year student (Tutee) who needs help with major or general courses or basic Korean, and a second or third-year student, or a student from another department (Tutor). This program aims to help Tutees gain confidence in university studies and provide Tutors with the benefit of working together for mutual learning.

## 4. How to Write an Email to a Professor 

### Ways to write an email:
Professors receive numerous emails a day. First, it is good to make it easy to know "who contacted you and for what reason" without having to open the email.
And when writing an email to professors, always use your Yonsei email address!
Sender: Your email address listed as @yonsei.ac.kr
Recipient: Professor's email address
Subject: Your student number + requirement
---
ex) Regarding 2025○○○○○○○ absence
Body: Dear Professor ○○
I am ○○, who is taking (course name).
I have had cold symptoms since yesterday, and when I woke up today, I had a fever, so I think I cannot go to class.
I will go to the hospital today and get a diagnosis.
Please take care of me.
From (Your name).

Body: Dear Professor ○○
I am ○○, who is taking (course name). I remember you explained the final assignment in the last lecture like ○○○. Can I submit it in PDF format?

!Caution!
